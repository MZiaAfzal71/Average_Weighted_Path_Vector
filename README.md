## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

### `Data Files/`

- **Zang_Data.xlsx**  
  Source dataset taken from:  
  > Zang, Q., Mansouri, K., Williams, A. J., Judson, R. S., Allen, D. G., Casey, W. M., & Kleinstreuer, N. C. (2017).  
  > *In silico prediction of physicochemical properties of environmental chemicals using molecular fingerprints and machine learning.*  
  > *Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling, 57*(1), 36â€“49.  

  The file contains six sheets with SMILES strings, experimental data, model predictions, and training/test splits.  
  It includes six physicochemical properties:

  - **Log VP** â€“ Logarithm of vapor pressure (VP), a measure of volatility  
  - **MP** â€“ Melting Point  
  - **BP** â€“ Boiling Point  
  - **Log BCF** â€“ Bioconcentration Factor, describing chemical accumulation in organisms  
  - **Log S** â€“ Aqueous Solubility  
  - **Log P** â€“ Lipophilicity (partition coefficient between *n*-octanol and water). In chemistry, *logP* quantifies how well a neutral compound dissolves in a nonpolar solvent (like octanol) compared to water.

- **Other folders**  
  - `Data Statistics/` â€“ Exploratory analysis and summary statistics  
  - `Descriptor Generators/` â€“ Colab notebooks to generate molecular descriptors  
  - `Models/` â€“ Colab notebooks for training and evaluating machine learning models

## ðŸš€ Running the Workflows

All experiments are implemented as **Google Colab notebooks**.  
You can open any notebook directly in Colab and execute cells sequentially to reproduce the results.
