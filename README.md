### `Data Files/`

- **Zang_Data.xlsx**  
  Source dataset taken from:  
  > Zang, Q., Mansouri, K., Williams, A. J., Judson, R. S., Allen, D. G., Casey, W. M., & Kleinstreuer, N. C. (2017).  
  > *In silico prediction of physicochemical properties of environmental chemicals using molecular fingerprints and machine learning.*

  The file contains six sheets with SMILES strings, experimental data, model predictions, and training/test splits.  
  It includes six physicochemical properties:

  - **Log VP** â€“ Logarithm of vapor pressure (volatility measure)  
  - **MP** â€“ Melting Point  
  - **BP** â€“ Boiling Point  
  - **Log BCF** â€“ Bioconcentration Factor (chemical accumulation in organisms)  
  - **Log S** â€“ Aqueous Solubility  
  - **Log P** â€“ Lipophilicity (partition coefficient between *n*-octanol and water).  
    In chemistry, *logP* quantifies how well a neutral compound dissolves in a nonpolar solvent (like octanol) compared to water.

- **Other folders**  
  - `Data Statistics/` â€“ Exploratory data analysis and summary statistics  
  - `Descriptor Generators/` â€“ Colab notebooks to generate molecular descriptors  
  - `Models/` â€“ Colab notebooks for training and evaluating machine learning models

## ðŸš€ Running the Workflows

All experiments are implemented as **Google Colab notebooks**.  
You can open any notebook in Colab and execute the cells sequentially to reproduce the results.  

Example:  
```text
Data Files/Descriptor Generators/GenerateDescriptorsData.ipynb

## âš¡ GPU Requirements

* Data Files/Models/ChemBERTaFiLMFusion.ipynb

* Relies on deep neural networks and is GPU-intensive.

* Running on a CPU is extremely slow and not recommended.

* Best run on Kaggle (GPU runtime) or Google Colab with GPU enabled.

## Other models

* Can be run efficiently on CPU-only systems without any issue.

* GPU is required only for neural-networkâ€“based models.

## ðŸ”— Data Availability (OSF)

To ensure reproducibility, some intermediate datasets generated during experiments are hosted on Open Science Framework (OSF).

* Each Colab notebook (usually in the second cell) contains the code required to fetch the relevant dataset directly from OSF.

* This means any dataset used or generated in the paper can be retrieved automatically when running the notebooks.
