# BoronicAcid_MeltingPoint_Prediction
This repository contains datasets, molecular descriptors, and ML models for predicting boronic acid melting points. A novel bond-distance summation descriptor is compared with traditional descriptors using DT, RF, XGBoost, LGBM, and SVR. Includes data, scripts, models, and results.
